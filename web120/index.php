 <p>I grew up in Seattle and love the Pacific Northwest</p>
 <p>I am a 4th generation Seattleite and my great grandmother owned a Scandinavian restaurant on Broadway in the late 1800's.</p>
 <p>I went to camp called Camp Colman that was located on the Puget Sound past Tacoma so I love all images of the Puget Sound.</p>
 <p>So far I have learned so much about coding and can't wait to learn more.</p>

 <p>I love the Pacific Northwest it is forever my home.</p>
 <p>I have much respect for the Pacific Northwest and for the Natives that inhabited the place before the European arrived. I think Mt Rainer shoud be turned back to its original name Mt Tahoma.</p>
